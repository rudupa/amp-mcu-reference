# Task: Phase 4 - Convert Domain Struct to JSON Schema

Status: Pending

Description: Define a domain JSON schema equivalent to the domain struct, covering core, entry, stack, shared memory, and size.

Plan:
- Draft a JSON schema that mirrors the domain struct fields and constraints.
- Create example JSON domain definitions for existing profiles.
- Add schema validation tooling (build-time or test-time) to catch errors.
- Integrate schema artifacts into the repo (docs and tooling).
- Validate current domain data against the schema.
- Document the schema fields and usage.

Coding Agent Prompt:
1. Understand the task scope and constraints.
2. Follow the plan above.
3. Create or modify required files in the repo.
4. Add or update documentation as specified by the task.
5. Build or lint the project to validate changes.
6. Prepare a pull request description summarizing work and verification.
