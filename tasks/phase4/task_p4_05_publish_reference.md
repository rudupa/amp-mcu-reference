# Task: Phase 4 - Publish the Reference Implementation

Status: Pending

Description: Publish a complete, standard-aligned AMP reference implementation with profiles (RP2350 A/M-class AMP, PolarFire SoC-class AMP, Zynq US+ heterogeneous AMP).

Plan:
- Package profiles for RP2350 (Profile A), PolarFire SoC (Profile B), and Zynq US+ (Profile C) with domain tables and manifests.
- Prepare build artifacts and scripts for each profile.
- Add release notes and README updates describing profiles and how to build/flash.
- Verify builds for each profile and capture results.
- Add publishing steps (archives, tags, or release pipeline stub).
- Document how upstreaming/selective publish is expected to work.

3. Create or modify required files in the repo.
4. Add or update documentation as specified by the task.
