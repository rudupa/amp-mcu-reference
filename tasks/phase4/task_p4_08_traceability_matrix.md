# Task: Phase 4 - Traceability Matrix for AMP Primitives

Status: Pending

Description: Build a traceability matrix linking safety goals/requirements to AMP primitives, tests, and documentation.

Plan:
- Identify safety requirements and map them to boot, IPC, shared memory, and lifecycle components.
- Create a traceability matrix artifact (e.g., CSV/Markdown) linking requirements to code, tests, and docs.
- Add CI check to ensure new changes maintain traceability coverage.
- Update documentation to describe traceability process and responsibilities.
- Generate sample report for current codebase highlighting gaps.
- Document how to extend the matrix for future changes.

Coding Agent Prompt:
1. Understand the task scope and constraints.
2. Follow the plan above.
3. Create or modify required files in the repo.
4. Add or update documentation as specified by the task.
5. Build or lint the project to validate changes.
